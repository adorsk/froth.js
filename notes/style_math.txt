would be nice to have a way to style math.

similar to how less or sass lets you do '37px + 43px = 80px;'.

can't do this in normal js context.

hmm.  Something like Decorado.eval(styleA + styleB)?

that might be a bit kludgy.  hmm.

hmm. yah, bit of a pain.  But not something to deal w/ now.

One idea is to use something like a wrapper function:

e.g. unitsFn = function(fn, args...):
  parsed_args = {}
  for each arg:
    parsed_args[arg_idx] = (arg_num, arg_unit)
  // Check if units differ.  If they do, throw error.
  // Otherwise, execute fn, and append units to the reuslt.
  num_result = fn(parsed_args.nums)
  return str(num_result) + units
