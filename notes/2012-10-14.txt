bonking a bit on how to go forward from here.

compilation output.  how will that work.

depends on environment.  How do I detect my environment?

check module and window global variables. a la underscore.

Now, how to do output?

in browser, I want workflow to be like this:

include Decorado.
Decorado.addStyle(style1)
Decorado.addStyle(style2)
Decorado.compile()

This will create <script> elements.

what about when I'm compiling files on the server?
In that case I want it to be more like:
decorado compile <my_module> config=/tmp/dec.config output_dir=/tmp/foo.

how will that work? basically my app will have 'require' calls.
The required modules will do decorado stuff.  app will compile, but decorado will *not* put out any <script> elements.  Instead the compiler program will take the compiled result, and then format it. Yah.
