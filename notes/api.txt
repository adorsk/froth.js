make the api more like jquery's.  Because we're essentially doing the same thing: manipulating a tree.

E.g. Froth.append({
  body: {
    width: 200,
    &.content : {
      width: 300
    }
  })

etc.

Now, is there any way for me to tap into jquery?  to see how it does it?


More thoughts on the tree idea.

Just a tree itself won't do it.  Need a way to make the search work.

This is where a db comes in.

Kind of like nodes and tags.


The db has these tables:

molecules
 - id (e.g. '.a')
 
atoms
 - id (e.g. '.a')
 
atoms_molecules
 - atom (e.g. 'a'
 - molecule ('.a .b.c')

molecules_children
 - parent_id ('.a')
 - child_id ('.b.c')


Then we have two basic operations: append and remove.

When we append a subtree: 
  for each node in subtree.walk:
    get molecule_id by joining parent path and current id
    split into atoms
    add molecule to molecule table
    update atoms with atoms
    update atoms_molecules
    update molecules_children
  add subtree to the jsoncss object as a child of the parent.

When we remove:
  for each match:
    if match is attached:
      for each node in match.walk:
        remove from molecule table
        remove from atoms_molecules
        remove from molecules_children
      detach match
    return match
 
This can work I think.
